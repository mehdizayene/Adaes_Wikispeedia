    which you can reach more specific articles. Examples of such articles include ‚ÄúEarth‚Äù, ‚ÄúUSA‚Äù,‚ÄùEurope‚Äù. To find a similar one,\
    you might ask yourself the following question: By accessing this article, will I have a wide range of options from which to choose my next hop? \
    If the answer is yes, then you got it. Once you find such an article, you should immediately start going more specific and try to get closer to your target. \
    Obviously, if your target is of a general topic like ‚ÄúUnited Kingdom‚Äù, you don‚Äôt need to go through this step. This is, however, very rare due to \
    skewed degree distribution of nodes in the graph, the reason for which we did not base our analysis on such outliers.")

st.write("Going through the article‚Äôs text, you might naturally find yourself attempting to get closer to your target semantically. That is you try to find \
    articles that have similar connotations and talk about close topics. Just don‚Äôt do it! In fact, you will waste a lot of time reading the articles just to \
    follow a strategy which is not even optimal. Instead, it‚Äôs better to just skim through the first lines of the article and quickly choose your next hop.\
